# 🐍 Python Programming Notes - Lecture 1

## 📘 Introduction to Programming Languages

### 🔹 What is a Programming Language?
A programming language is a way to give instructions to a computer. It helps us write code to create software, websites, games, and more.

### 🧠 Types of Programming Languages

#### 1. 🖥️ Machine Language
- Made of 0s and 1s (binary code)
- Directly understood by the computer
- Very fast but hard to understand for humans

#### 2. ⚙️ Assembly Language
- Uses short words (called *mnemonics*) like `MOV`, `ADD`, `SUB`
- Easier than machine language, but still hardware-specific
- Needs an **assembler** to convert it into machine language

#### 3. 🧑‍💻 High-Level Language (like Python)
- Easy to read and write
- Looks similar to English
- Portable (can run on many computers)
- Needs a **compiler** or **interpreter** to run
- Examples: Python, Java, C, JavaScript

### ✅ Comparison Table
| Feature              | Machine Language | Assembly Language | High-Level Language |
|----------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Readability          | ❌ Very Hard     | ⚠️ Hard            | ✅ Easy              |
| Ease of Writing      | ❌ Difficult     | ⚠️ Moderate        | ✅ Easy              |
| Speed                | ✅ Very Fast     | ✅ Fast            | ⚠️ Moderate          |
| Portability          | ❌ None          | ⚠️ Limited         | ✅ High              |
| Abstraction Level    | ❌ None          | ⚠️ Low             | ✅ High              |
| Error-Prone          | ❌ High          | ⚠️ Moderate        | ✅ Low               |

### 📝 Summary
- Machine Language: Fast but very hard to use.
- Assembly Language: Easier than machine code, still hardware-specific.
- High-Level Languages: Human-friendly, portable, and best for beginners.

## 🧠 Variables in Python

> 🔰 A variable is like a **label on a box** — it holds something for later use.

### 🧊 What is a Variable?

A **variable** is a name used to store data that can change during program execution. It's a core concept in every programming language.

🧪 **Real-life example:** Just like you save someone's contact as "Mom" on your phone, Python saves values with a name (variable).

```python
mom = "9876543210"
```

---

### 🛠️ How to Declare a Variable

Use this format:

```python
variable_name = value
```

✅ Examples:

```python
name = "Aarav"
age = 18
pi = 3.14
```

### 🚦 Rules for Naming Variables

| Rule                            | Example ✅       | Example ❌     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Must start with a letter or `_` | `age`, `_score` | `1name` ❌     |
| No special characters           | `user_name`     | `user-name` ❌ |
| Case-sensitive                  | `Name`, `name`  | are different |

### ✏️ Example: Basic Variable Usage

```python
name = "Riya"
age = 21
city = "Delhi"

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("City:", city)
```

**Output:**

```
Name: Riya
Age: 21
City: Delhi
```

### 🔁 Reassigning Values

```python
score = 50
print("Score:", score)

score = 90  # updated
print("Updated Score:", score)
```

## 🧪 Practice Set 3: Variables in Python

1. 🔡 Create 3 variables: your name, hobby, and favorite color. Print them.
2. 🔁 Change a variable's value and print both the original and updated value.
3. 🔢 Create a variable for your birth year and calculate your age.
4. 🎨 Create a variable and print a message like: "My favorite color is Blue."
5. ❌ Try a wrong variable name (`2name = "John"`) and correct it.
